\section{Reduced artificial instance}
Working on the entire genomes would be prohibitive for such approach, and many of the existent solutions make assumptions on the nature of the genomes, as we've seen.

We take into consideration a reduced instace, designing a Python script which procedually generates an instance of the problem with given specific characteristics.

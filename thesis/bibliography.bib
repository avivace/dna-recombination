The reduction graph is a useful tool for the analysis of the SPRS, providing valuable information about the way that gene assembly is performed for a given gene. The GPRS is more abstract than the SPRS -- not all information present in the SPRS is retained in the GPRS. As a consequence the reduction graph cannot be defined for the GPRS in general, but we show that it can be defined if we restrict ourselves to the so-called realistic overlap graphs (which correspond to genes occurring in nature). Defining the reduction graph within the GPRS allows one to carry over from the SPRS to the GPRS several results that rely on the reduction graph.",

abstract="We present a branch-and-bound (bb) algorithm for the multiple sequence alignment problem (MSA), one of the most important problems in computational biology. The upper bound at each bb node is based on a Lagrangian relaxation of an integer linear programming formulation for MSA. Dualizing certain inequalities, the Lagrangian subproblem becomes a pairwise alignment problem, which can be solved efficiently by a dynamic programming approach. Due to a reformulation w.r.t. additionally introduced variables prior to relaxation we improve the convergence rate dramatically while at the same time being able to solve the Lagrangian problem efficiently. Our experiments show that our implementation, although preliminary, outperforms all exact algorithms for the multiple sequence alignment problem.",

abstract="The investigation of genetic differences among humans has given evidence that mutations in DNA sequences are responsible for some genetic diseases. The most common mutation is the one that involves only a single nucleotide of the DNA sequence, which is called a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). As a consequence, computing a complete map of all SNPs occurring in the human populations is one of the primary goals of recent studies in human genomics. The construction of such a map requires to determine the DNA sequences that from all chromosomes. In diploid organisms like humans, each chromosome consists of two sequences calledhaplotypes. Distinguishing the information contained in both haplotypes when analyzing chromosome sequences poses several new computational issues which collectively form a new emerging topic of Computational Biology known asHaplotyping.",

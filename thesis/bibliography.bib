In this bibliography, we survey some of the most significant contributions that were made to the field and which employ mathematical programming techniques, while giving a broad overview of application areas of modern computational molecular biology. The areas include sequence analysis, microarrays, protein structure and function, haplotyping and evolutionary distances.},

abstract="The string pointer reduction system (SPRS) and the graph pointer reduction system (GPRS) are important formal models of gene assembly in ciliates. The reduction graph is a useful tool for the analysis of the SPRS, providing valuable information about the way that gene assembly is performed for a given gene. The GPRS is more abstract than the SPRS -- not all information present in the SPRS is retained in the GPRS. As a consequence the reduction graph cannot be defined for the GPRS in general, but we show that it can be defined if we restrict ourselves to the so-called realistic overlap graphs (which correspond to genes occurring in nature). Defining the reduction graph within the GPRS allows one to carry over from the SPRS to the GPRS several results that rely on the reduction graph.",

We introduce the \textit{Computational Biology} field and familiarise with \textit{Integer Linear Programming}, defining its inception, uses and approach, and how ILP-based approaches have become a standard optimization technique in bioinformatics, reviewing an application.

Then, we formalise the "DNA Recombination and Rearrangement" problem based on the what is observed in some species of ciliates, followed by an analysis and report of some of existent approaches and their central ideas, limitations and reductions applied.

Finally, an ILP formulation of the DNA Recombination problem is given, describing the implementative tools used and the main encountered difficulties.

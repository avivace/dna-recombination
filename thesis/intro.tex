\section{Computational Biology and Bioinformatics} 
 
\textit{Computational Biology} is defined as the development and application of data-analytical and theoretical methods, mathematical modeling and computational simulation techniques to the study of biological, behavioral, and social systems\cite{nihdef}.

Some of the most important challenges in the field includes\cite{2}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Protein structure prediction;
\item Homology searches;
\item Multiple alignment and phylogeny construction;
\item Genomic sequence analysis and gene-finding.
\end{itemize}

In particular, \textit{Computational Molecular Biology} (bioinformatics) focuses on studying existing and emerging approaches, techniques and algorithms for string computation (sequences) providing a significant intersection between computer science and molecular biology.

Note that the term "bioinformatics" [...]

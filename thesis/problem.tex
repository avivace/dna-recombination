The ciliate Oxytricha is a microbial eukaryote with two genomes, one of which experiences
extensive genome remodeling during development. Each round of conjugation initiates a cascade
of events that construct a transcriptionally active somatic genome from a scrambled germline
genome, with considerable help from both long and small noncoding RNAs. This process of
